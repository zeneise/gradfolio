My job is to build bridges between awesome people and cutting-edge technology – currently, as a Product Manager for an enterprise engineering visualization platform at a German automotive OEM. Prior to that, I led various digitalization projects with focus on Augmented, Mixed and Virtual Reality as well as structural simulation and optimization.

I received a Dr.-Ing. (PhD) degree in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Information Technology from Technical University Berlin and a Dipl.-Ing. degree in Aeronautics and Aerospace from Technical University Munich.

In my freetime, I enjoy exploring foreign countries, cultures and cuisines, playing basketball, and reading a good book – mainly, about technology, natural sciences, business or ancient roman history.
